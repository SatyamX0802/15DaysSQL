Question 1: Equality Search Index
You frequently run this query:
SELECT *
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst';

Task
Use EXPLAIN to observe query behavior
Create the most appropriate index
Re-run EXPLAIN and compare:
type
rows
key
🎯 Focus: single-column index, equality lookup

Question 2: Composite Index (Filter + Filter)
You need to fetch jobs based on role and location:
SELECT *
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Scientist'
  AND job_country = 'India';

Task
Decide:
One composite index OR
Two separate indexes
Create the best option
Verify index usage using EXPLAIN

🎯 Focus: composite index & column order

Question 3: Index on Boolean / Low Cardinality Column
This query runs very often:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_work_from_home = TRUE;

Task
Should you create an index on job_work_from_home?
Try creating it and inspect EXPLAIN
Decide whether the index is useful or wasteful

🎯 Focus: low cardinality indexing decision

Question 4: Range Query on Date
You analyze recent job postings:
SELECT job_title, company_name
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_posted_date >= '2024-01-15';

Task
Create an index to optimize this query
Check if MySQL uses:
range
ALL
Validate using EXPLAIN
🎯 Focus: range scans and date indexing

Question 5: Sorting + Filtering Performance
You often execute:
SELECT job_title, salary_year_avg
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_country = 'USA'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;

Task
Create an index to minimize sorting cost
Check Extra column for:
Using filesort
Optimize it
🎯 Focus: index for WHERE + ORDER BY

Question 6: Index for NULL Filtering
This query checks salary availability:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL;

Task
Create an index on salary_year_avg
Observe if MySQL uses the index
Analyze whether indexing this column is justified
🎯 Focus: indexing nullable columns

Question 7: Composite Index with Range Condition
You need high-paying remote jobs:
SELECT job_title, company_name
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_work_from_home = TRUE
  AND salary_year_avg > 120000;

Task
Create a composite index
Decide correct column order
Check if both conditions are used by the index
🎯 Focus: equality + range rule

Question 8: LIKE Pattern and Index Usage
You search jobs containing a skill:
SELECT *
FROM janjobopenings
WHERE job_skills LIKE '%Python%';

Task
Run EXPLAIN
Try indexing job_skills
Analyze why index may or may not be used
🎯 Focus: leading wildcard and index limitations

Question 9: Index on Grouped Queries
You generate this report daily:
SELECT job_country, COUNT(*) AS total_jobs
FROM janjobopenings
GROUP BY job_country;

Task
Create an index to support this query
Check whether MySQL uses it
Observe Using temporary or Using index
🎯 Focus: indexes for GROUP BY

Question 10: Over-Indexing Scenario (Critical Thinking)
Suppose you create indexes on:
job_title_short
job_country
job_location
company_name
salary_year_avg
job_posted_date

Task
Identify which indexes are most valuable
Identify which ones are likely wasteful
Justify your answer based on:
Query patterns
Cardinality
Write overhead
🎯 Focus: real-world index strategy


-----------------------------------------

How You Should Practice These (IMPORTANT)
For each question, always do:
EXPLAIN SELECT ...
Check:
type
key
rows
Extra

Then:
Create index
Re-run EXPLAIN
Compare results
